# knapsack-problem
## knapsack problem using evolutionary algorithm with two selection methods
This project is done on **Google Colaboratory**.

This optimization problem is done with these settings:

  - Population management = Generational model
  - Representation = Binary
  - Parent selection = FPS & another selection 
  - Implementing selection probabilities = Stuchastic universal sampling
  - Crossover = One_point crossover
  - Crossover pobability = 0.8
  - Mutation = Bit_flip mutation
  - Mutation probability = 0.4
  ***
  - Number of objects (gen) = 10
  - Number of population (chromosume) = 8
  - Number of generation = 50
  - M (Maximum weight of the bag) = 50
  - Range of weights = 1-20
  - Range of values = 100-1000
