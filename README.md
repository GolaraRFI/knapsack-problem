# Knapsack Problem

## Solving the Knapsack Problem Using Evolutionary Algorithms with Two Selection Methods

This project was conducted using **Google Colaboratory**.

The optimization problem was approached with the following settings:

- Population Management: Generational Model
- Representation: Binary
- Parent Selection: FPS (Fitness-Proportionate Selection) & Another Selection Method
- Implementing Selection Probabilities: Stochastic Universal Sampling
- Crossover: One-Point Crossover
- Crossover Probability: 0.8
- Mutation: Bit-Flip Mutation
- Mutation Probability: 0.4

Additional Details:
- Number of Objects (Genes): 10
- Number of Populations (Chromosomes): 8
- Number of Generations: 50
- Maximum Weight Capacity of the Knapsack (M): 50
- Range of Weights for Objects: 1-20
- Range of Values for Objects: 100-1000
